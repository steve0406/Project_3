There is not a single person alive right now that has not been affected by COVID-19 a few years ago. Countries all accross the world was adversly affected to varying degrees. In this project we aim to gain some more insights into how different countries were affected. We aim to look at countries with the highest population and tourism to see if there is any correlation between the amount of cases and deaths within those countries. We also would are going to make the comparison of the highest deaths along with the mean age in those countries.

Some ethical considerations that we took was we ensured that the data we used did not include any Personal Indentifiable Information (PII). Every metric and parameter that is available in this dataset cannot be used to identify anyone.
